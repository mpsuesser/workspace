Bind docs to code and check for drift.

Any markdown file in your repo can declare anchors to code — specific files or AST symbols. When bound code changes, `drift check` flags the doc as stale. Agents that change code must update the docs they affect.

## Usage

Write a markdown doc, then bind it to code:

```
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/login.ts
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
```

`drift link` writes the binding to `drift.lock` at the repo root and stamps a content signature — an AST fingerprint of the target file or symbol. It hashes what's on disk, so uncommitted files work fine. You can also reference code inline — `@./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig` in the doc body — and `drift link` will stamp those too.

Check if docs are fresh:

```
drift check
```

Refresh all anchors in a doc after updating it:

```
drift link docs/auth.md
```

### What a doc anchor looks like

After linking, bindings live in `drift.lock` at the repo root:

```
docs/auth.md -> src/auth/login.ts sig:e4f8a2c10b3d7890
docs/auth.md -> src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890
```

You can also use inline references in the doc body — `@./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig` — and `drift link` will stamp those in the lockfile too.

Every anchor has three parts:

```
src/auth/provider.ts   #AuthConfig   sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890
└── file path ──────┘  └─ symbol ─┘  └──── signature ────┘
```

- **Path** — the file you're binding to, relative to the repo root.
- **Symbol** — optional `#Name` suffix that narrows the anchor to a specific declaration (function, class, type). Only changes to that symbol trigger staleness.
- **Signature** — content fingerprint stamped by `drift link`. An XxHash3 hash of the file or symbol's normalized AST, so staleness detection doesn't depend on VCS history. Rebasing, amending, or linking uncommitted files all work. Per-anchor, so different files track independently.

### Cross-repo docs (origin)

Docs that travel across repo boundaries — installed skills, vendored docs, shared templates — can declare where their anchors belong via a trailing `origin:` field:

```
docs/skill.md -> src/main.zig sig:a1b2c3d4e5f67890 origin:github:fiberplane/drift
```

When `origin` doesn't match the current repo, `drift check` skips those anchors instead of reporting false "file not found" errors. Anchors without `origin` are always checked.

## Commands

```
drift check         Check all docs for staleness (exits 1 if stale)
drift status        Show all doc anchors from drift.lock
drift link          Add or refresh bindings in drift.lock
drift unlink        Remove a binding from drift.lock
drift refs          Reverse lookup — which docs reference a given file
```

`drift lint` is an alias for `drift check`.

## How staleness works

Each anchor's `sig:` field records a fingerprint of the code at the time it was linked. `drift check` recomputes the fingerprint from the current file and compares. For supported languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Zig, Java), comparison is syntax-aware — drift parses with tree-sitter and hashes a normalized AST fingerprint (node kinds + token text, no whitespace or position data). Reformatting won't trigger false positives. Symbol-level anchors (`#AuthConfig`) narrow this to just that declaration's subtree. Unsupported languages fall back to raw content comparison.

No VCS history is needed for staleness detection — `drift check` works entirely from the stored signature and current file content.

```
$ drift check

docs/auth.md
  STALE   src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig (changed after doc)
          changed by mike in e4f8a2c (Mar 15)
          "refactor: split auth config into separate concerns"
  STALE   src/core/old-module.ts (file not found)
  ok      src/auth/login.ts

docs/payments.md
  ok

1 doc stale, 1 ok
```

## CI

`drift check` exits 1 when any doc is stale, so it works as a CI gate:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/drift.yml
name: Drift
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: fiberplane/drift@main
      - run: drift check
```

For faster CI runs, use `--changed` to scope checking to docs affected by the files that changed in the PR:

```yaml
      - run: drift check --changed src/auth
```

`fetch-depth: 0` is recommended — drift uses VCS history for blame info on stale anchors. With `sig:` provenance (the default), staleness detection itself doesn't need history. The setup action auto-detects platform, downloads the right binary from GitHub releases, and verifies its checksum before installing.
