# Part 2: Add a Worker

In [Part 1](./part-1.md) you deployed an R2 Bucket. Now you'll create a Cloudflare Worker that reads and writes objects in that bucket over HTTP.

## Create the Worker file

Create `src/worker.ts`. A Worker is a special kind of Resource — it has both an infrastructure definition and a runtime implementation expressed as an Effect.

```ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Worker",
  {
    main: import.meta.path,
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        return HttpServerResponse.text("Hello, world!");
      }),
    };
  }),
);
```

## Bind the Bucket to the Worker

Now let's bind the R2 Bucket from Part 1 to our new Worker. The problem is that the Bucket is declared inside the Stack's generator in `alchemy.run.ts` — we can't import it from there.

A common pattern in Alchemy is to give each resource its own file. Create `src/bucket.ts`:

```ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";

export const Bucket = Cloudflare.R2Bucket("Bucket");
```

Update `alchemy.run.ts` to import it instead of declaring it inline:

```ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { Bucket } from "./src/bucket.ts";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Bucket;
    return {
      bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
    };
  }),
);
```

Now the Worker can import `Bucket` and bind it in the Init phase:

```ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";
import { Bucket } from "./bucket.ts";

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Worker",
  {
    main: import.meta.path,
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Error ts(2345) — Type 'R2BucketBinding' is not assignable to type 'WorkerServices | PlatformServices'.
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2Bucket.bind(Bucket);
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        return HttpServerResponse.text("Hello, world!");
      }),
    };
  }),
);
```

## Provide the binding layer

The previous step showed a type error — `R2Bucket.bind` requires the `R2BucketBinding` service. Fix it by piping the outer Effect through `R2BucketBindingLive`:

```ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";
import { Bucket } from "./bucket.ts";

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Worker",
  { main: import.meta.path },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2Bucket.bind(Bucket);
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        return HttpServerResponse.text("Hello, world!");
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2BucketBindingLive)),
);
```

`R2BucketBindingLive` tells the Worker runtime how to look up the underlying R2 binding from the Cloudflare environment. Without it, `bind` wouldn't know where to find the bucket at runtime.

## Add the PUT handler

Let's replace the placeholder response with a PUT route that stores objects in the bucket. Add `HttpServerRequest` to access the incoming request:

```ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { HttpServerRequest } from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerRequest";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";
import { Bucket } from "./bucket.ts";

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Worker",
  { main: import.meta.path },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2Bucket.bind(Bucket);
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
        const key = request.url.split("/").pop()!;
        if (request.method === "PUT") {
          yield* bucket.put(key, request.stream, {
            contentLength: Number(request.headers["content-length"] ?? 0),
          });
          return HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 201 });
        }
        return HttpServerResponse.text("Hello, world!");
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2BucketBindingLive)),
);
```

TypeScript flags a type error. The `bucket.put` call can fail with `R2Error`, but a Worker's `fetch` handler only allows `HttpServerError` or `HttpBodyError`. Effect tracks this in the type system — you can't forget to handle it.

Pipe the fetch Effect through `Effect.catchTag` to convert `R2Error` into a 500 response:

```ts
return {
  fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
    const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
    const key = request.url.split("/").pop()!;
    if (request.method === "PUT") {
      yield* bucket.put(key, request.stream, {
        contentLength: Number(request.headers["content-length"] ?? 0),
      });
      return HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 201 });
    }
    return HttpServerResponse.text("Hello, world!");
  }).pipe(
    Effect.catchTag("R2Error", (error) =>
      Effect.succeed(
        HttpServerResponse.text(error.message, { status: 500 }),
      ),
    ),
  ),
};
```

`Effect.catchTag` matches errors by their `_tag` field. If an R2 operation fails at runtime, the Worker returns a 500 instead of crashing — and the type error disappears because `R2Error` is now fully handled.

## Add the GET handler

Complete the fetch handler by reading objects from the bucket when the request isn't a PUT:

```ts
fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
  const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
  const key = request.url.split("/").pop()!;
  if (request.method === "PUT") {
    yield* bucket.put(key, request.stream, {
      contentLength: Number(request.headers["content-length"] ?? 0),
    });
    return HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 201 });
  }
  const object = yield* bucket.get(key);
  if (object === null) {
    return HttpServerResponse.text("Not found", { status: 404 });
  }
  const text = yield* object.text();
  return HttpServerResponse.text(text);
}).pipe(
  Effect.catchTag("R2Error", (error) =>
    Effect.succeed(
      HttpServerResponse.text(error.message, { status: 500 }),
    ),
  ),
),
```

The Worker now handles two routes:

- **`PUT /:key`** — stores the request body in the bucket
- **`GET /:key`** — retrieves the object, returning 404 if missing

Because `bucket.get` also returns `R2Error`, the `catchTag` you added in the previous step already covers it — no additional error handling needed.

## Wire the Worker into the Stack

Add the Worker to `alchemy.run.ts` and expose its URL as a stack output:

```ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { Bucket } from "./src/bucket.ts";
import Worker from "./src/worker.ts";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Bucket;
    const worker = yield* Worker;
    return {
      bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
      url: worker.url,
    };
  }),
);
```

Deploy again. Alchemy detects the new Worker and the unchanged Bucket:

```
Plan: 1 to create

+ Worker (Cloudflare.Worker) (1 bindings)
  + Bucket
• Bucket (Cloudflare.R2Bucket)

Proceed?
◉ Yes ○ No
• Bucket (Cloudflare.R2Bucket) no change
✓ Worker (Cloudflare.Worker) created
  • Uploading worker (14.20 KB) ...
  • Enabling workers.dev subdomain...
{
  bucketName: "myapp-bucket-a1b2c3d4e5",
  url: "https://myapp-worker-dev-you-abc123.workers.dev",
}
```

Use `curl` to write and read an object:

```sh
# Store an object
curl -X PUT https://myapp-worker-dev-you-abc123.workers.dev/hello.txt \
  -d 'Hello, world!'

# Retrieve it
curl https://myapp-worker-dev-you-abc123.workers.dev/hello.txt
# → Hello, world!
```

## Recap

You now have:

- A Cloudflare Worker with GET and PUT routes
- An R2 Bucket bound to the Worker
- Stack outputs showing both the bucket name and worker URL

In [Part 3](./part-3.md), you'll learn about stages and state stores so multiple developers (and CI) can deploy isolated environments.
