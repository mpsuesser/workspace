# jest/no-commented-out-tests

## What it does

This rule raises a warning about commented-out tests. It's similar to the
`no-disabled-tests` rule.

### Why is this bad?

You may forget to uncomment some tests. This rule raises a warning about commented-out tests.

It is generally better to skip a test if it's flaky, or remove it if it's no longer needed.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
// describe('foo', () => {});
// it('foo', () => {});
// test('foo', () => {});

// describe.skip('foo', () => {});
// it.skip('foo', () => {});
// test.skip('foo', () => {});
```

## Version

This rule was added in v0.0.8.
