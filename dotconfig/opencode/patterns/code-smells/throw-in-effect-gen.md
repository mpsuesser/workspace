# Do Not `throw` Inside `Effect.gen`

```haskell
-- Transformation
throw :: Error -> ⊥                        -- untyped, uncatchable by Effect
yield* Effect.fail :: TaggedError -> E ⊥ E  -- typed, catchable via catchTag
```

```haskell
-- Pattern
bad :: Effect.gen
bad = Effect.gen \_ -> do
  throw new Error("not found")            -- bypasses Effect error channel

good :: Effect.gen
good = Effect.gen \_ -> do
  yield* Effect.fail(new UserNotFoundError({ message: "not found" }))
  -- typed error, catchable with catchTag("UserNotFoundError", ...)
```

`throw` inside `Effect.gen` creates a defect (untyped), not a typed error. Use `yield* Effect.fail(new SchemaTaggedError(...))` to keep errors in the typed channel.

Exception: `throw` inside `Effect.tryPromise`'s `try` block is acceptable — it's caught by the `catch` handler.
