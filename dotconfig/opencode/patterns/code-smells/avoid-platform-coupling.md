# Avoid Platform Coupling in Bindings

```haskell
-- Transformation
concrete :: @effect/platform-bun    -- tied to Bun runtime
abstract :: @effect/platform        -- portable across runtimes

-- Pattern
bad  :: packages/*/binding/
bad  = import { BunContext } from "@effect/platform-bun"
bad  = dependencies: [BunContext.layer]      -- hardwired platform

good :: packages/*/binding/
good = dependencies: []                      -- no platform coupling
good = -- runtime provides CommandExecutor, FileSystem, etc.
```

Binding packages wrap external systems (CLIs, APIs, databases) and must be platform-agnostic. They should depend on `@effect/platform` (abstract interfaces like `CommandExecutor`, `HttpClient`, `FileSystem`) but never on `@effect/platform-bun` or `@effect/platform-node` (concrete implementations).

Platform-specific layers (`BunContext.layer`, `NodeContext.layer`) belong in the runtime or CLI entry point, not in bindings. The terminal runtime merges `BunContext.layer` and provides `CommandExecutor` to all services automatically.
