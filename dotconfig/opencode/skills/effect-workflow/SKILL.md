## IMPORTANT: Unstable API

The workflow module lives under `effect/unstable/workflow`. APIs may change between versions. All imports use this path:

```ts
import { Workflow, Activity, WorkflowEngine, DurableClock, DurableDeferred } from "effect/unstable/workflow"
```

## Core Concepts

Effect Workflow provides **durable execution** — workflows that survive process restarts through event sourcing. The key idea: activities are the units of side-effectful work whose results get persisted. On replay, persisted results are returned without re-executing the activity.

### Architecture

```
Workflow  →  defines the overall process (name, payload, success/error schemas)
Activity  →  a discrete unit of work inside a workflow (results are persisted)
WorkflowEngine  →  orchestrates execution, replay, suspension, resumption
DurableClock  →  sleep/timer that persists across restarts
DurableDeferred  →  wait-for-external-signal that persists across restarts
```

## Workflow Definition

Use `Workflow.make` to define a workflow. Every workflow has:
- A unique `name`
- A `payload` schema (struct fields or Schema)
- An `idempotencyKey` function that produces a deterministic execution ID from the payload
- Optional `success` and `error` schemas (default `Schema.Void` / `Schema.Never`)

```ts
import { Workflow } from "effect/unstable/workflow"
import { Schema } from "effect"

const SendEmail = Workflow.make({
  name: "SendEmail",
  payload: {
    to: Schema.String,
    subject: Schema.String,
    body: Schema.String
  },
  idempotencyKey: (payload) => `${payload.to}:${payload.subject}`,
  success: Schema.Void,
  error: Schema.String
})
```

### Registering a Workflow Handler

Use `workflow.toLayer(handler)` to register the execution logic. The handler receives the decoded payload and execution ID:

```ts
const SendEmailLive = SendEmail.toLayer((payload, executionId) =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    // Activities go here — their results are persisted
    yield* validateRecipient  // an Activity
    yield* sendViaProvider    // an Activity
  })
)
```

### Executing a Workflow

```ts
// Execute and wait for result
const result = yield* SendEmail.execute({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Hello",
  body: "World"
})

// Fire-and-forget — returns the execution ID
const executionId = yield* SendEmail.execute(
  { to: "user@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "World" },
  { discard: true }
)

// Poll for result
const result = yield* SendEmail.poll(executionId)
// returns Result<A, E> | undefined

// Interrupt a running workflow
yield* SendEmail.interrupt(executionId)

// Resume a suspended workflow
yield* SendEmail.resume(executionId)
```

### Deterministic Execution ID

The execution ID is computed as a hash of `"${name}-${idempotencyKey(payload)}"`. This means executing the same workflow with the same payload is idempotent — it returns the existing execution rather than starting a new one.

```ts
const id = yield* SendEmail.executionId({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Hello",
  body: "World"
})
```

## Activities

Activities are the **atomic units of work** inside a workflow. Their results are persisted by the engine, so on replay they return the cached result without re-executing.

```ts
import { Activity } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

const validateRecipient = Activity.make({
  name: "ValidateRecipient",
  success: Schema.Struct({ valid: Schema.Boolean }),
  error: Schema.String,
  execute: Effect.gen(function*() {
    // This code runs at most once per workflow execution
    // (unless the activity itself fails and is retried)
    const result = yield* checkEmailService(payload.to)
    return { valid: result.isValid }
  })
})
```

### Activity is Yieldable

An `Activity` implements `Effect.Yieldable`, so you can yield it directly inside a workflow handler:

```ts
const handler = SendEmail.toLayer((payload, executionId) =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const validation = yield* validateRecipient  // yields the Activity directly
  })
)
```

### Activity Retry

Use `Activity.retry` to retry an effect within an activity. This tracks attempt counts:

```ts
import { Activity } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

const sendWithRetry = Activity.make({
  name: "SendWithRetry",
  success: Schema.Void,
  error: Schema.String,
  execute: pipe(
    sendEmailEffect,
    Activity.retry({ times: 3 })
  )
})
```

### Interrupt Retry Policy

Activities have a built-in `interruptRetryPolicy` — if an activity is interrupted (e.g., by process shutdown), it automatically retries with exponential backoff up to 10 times. You can override this:

```ts
Activity.make({
  name: "LongRunning",
  execute: longRunningEffect,
  interruptRetryPolicy: Schedule.recurs(5)
})
```

### Idempotency Keys

Generate deterministic idempotency keys for external API calls within activities:

```ts
const key = yield* Activity.idempotencyKey("stripe-charge")
// Incorporates the execution ID + activity name

// Include the attempt number for retry-aware keys
const keyWithAttempt = yield* Activity.idempotencyKey("stripe-charge", {
  includeAttempt: true
})
```

### Racing Activities

Race multiple activities — the first to complete wins, and the result is durably stored:

```ts
const result = yield* Activity.raceAll("fastest-provider", [
  sendViaProviderA,
  sendViaProviderB,
  sendViaProviderC
])
```

## DurableClock — Durable Sleep

`DurableClock.sleep` creates a timer that survives process restarts. Short sleeps (<=60s by default) run in-memory as regular activities. Longer sleeps are scheduled through the engine.

```ts
import { DurableClock } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

// Inside a workflow handler:
yield* DurableClock.sleep({
  name: "wait-before-retry",
  duration: "30 minutes"
})

// Customize the in-memory threshold (default 60 seconds)
yield* DurableClock.sleep({
  name: "cooldown",
  duration: "5 minutes",
  inMemoryThreshold: "2 minutes"  // sleeps <= 2min run in-memory
})
```

Under the hood, a DurableClock creates a `DurableDeferred` and the engine schedules a wake-up after the duration elapses.

## DurableDeferred — Wait for External Signals

`DurableDeferred` lets a workflow pause and wait for an external event (e.g., a webhook, user approval, payment confirmation). The state is persisted, so the workflow can resume after restart.

### Creating and Awaiting

```ts
import { DurableDeferred } from "effect/unstable/workflow"
import { Schema, Exit } from "effect"

// Define the deferred with typed schemas
const PaymentConfirmation = DurableDeferred.make("payment-confirmation", {
  success: Schema.Struct({ transactionId: Schema.String }),
  error: Schema.String
})

// Inside a workflow: wait for the signal
const confirmation = yield* DurableDeferred.await(PaymentConfirmation)
```

### Completing from Outside

External code (e.g., a webhook handler) completes the deferred using a **token**:

```ts
// Inside the workflow: generate a token to give to external systems
const token = yield* DurableDeferred.token(PaymentConfirmation)
// token is a branded string encoding workflow + execution + deferred name

// --- Later, from outside the workflow (e.g., webhook handler): ---

// Succeed
yield* DurableDeferred.succeed(PaymentConfirmation, {
  token,
  value: { transactionId: "tx_123" }
})

// Or fail
yield* DurableDeferred.fail(PaymentConfirmation, {
  token,
  error: "Payment declined"
})

// Or use done() with a full Exit
yield* DurableDeferred.done(PaymentConfirmation, {
  token,
  exit: Exit.succeed({ transactionId: "tx_123" })
})
```

### Token Generation Without Being Inside a Workflow

You can generate tokens from outside a workflow if you know the workflow and payload:

```ts
// From execution ID
const token = DurableDeferred.tokenFromExecutionId(PaymentConfirmation, {
  workflow: SendEmail,
  executionId: "abc123"
})

// From payload (computes the execution ID)
const token = yield* DurableDeferred.tokenFromPayload(PaymentConfirmation, {
  workflow: SendEmail,
  payload: { to: "user@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "World" }
})
```

### Token Parsing

Tokens are base64url-encoded and can be parsed:

```ts
const parsed = DurableDeferred.TokenParsed.fromString(token)
// { workflowName: "SendEmail", executionId: "abc123", deferredName: "payment-confirmation" }
```

### Piping an Effect into a DurableDeferred

`DurableDeferred.into` runs an effect and stores its result in the deferred on completion:

```ts
yield* pipe(
  someEffect,
  DurableDeferred.into(PaymentConfirmation)
)
```

### Racing with DurableDeferred

`DurableDeferred.raceAll` races multiple effects and durably stores the first result:

```ts
const result = yield* DurableDeferred.raceAll({
  name: "first-response",
  success: Schema.String,
  error: Schema.Never,
  effects: [fetchFromA, fetchFromB]
})
```

## Compensation (Saga Pattern)

`Workflow.withCompensation` registers rollback logic that runs if the **entire workflow** fails. This enables the saga pattern for distributed transactions.

```ts
const handler = OrderWorkflow.toLayer((payload, executionId) =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    // Reserve inventory — if workflow fails later, compensate
    const reservation = yield* pipe(
      reserveInventory,
      OrderWorkflow.withCompensation((reservationId, cause) =>
        cancelReservation(reservationId)
      )
    )

    // Charge payment — if workflow fails later, compensate
    const charge = yield* pipe(
      chargePayment,
      OrderWorkflow.withCompensation((chargeId, cause) =>
        refundPayment(chargeId)
      )
    )

    // Ship order — no compensation needed for the last step
    yield* shipOrder(reservation, charge)
  })
)
```

The compensation function receives:
1. The **success value** of the compensated effect (so you can use it for rollback)
2. The **Cause** of the workflow failure

**Important**: Compensation only works for top-level effects in the workflow, not for nested activities.

## Workflow Annotations

### CaptureDefects

Controls whether defects (unexpected errors) are captured in the workflow result. Default: `true`.

```ts
const MyWorkflow = Workflow.make({ ... }).annotate(Workflow.CaptureDefects, false)
```

### SuspendOnFailure

When `true`, the workflow suspends on any error instead of failing. You can then manually resume it:

```ts
const MyWorkflow = Workflow.make({ ... }).annotate(Workflow.SuspendOnFailure, true)

// Later, after fixing the issue:
yield* MyWorkflow.resume(executionId)
```

## Workflow Scope

Access the workflow's scope, which lives for the entire execution (across replays):

```ts
// Get the scope
const workflowScope = yield* Workflow.scope

// Provide scope to a scoped effect
yield* Workflow.provideScope(myScopedEffect)

// Add a finalizer to the workflow scope
yield* Workflow.addFinalizer((exit) =>
  Effect.log(`Workflow completed with: ${exit}`)
)
```

## WorkflowEngine

The `WorkflowEngine` is a service that orchestrates workflow execution. It handles registration, execution, replay, suspension, and resumption.

### In-Memory Engine (Testing/Development)

For testing and local development, use the in-memory engine:

```ts
import { WorkflowEngine } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

const TestLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
  SendEmailLive,
  // ... other workflow registrations
).pipe(
  Layer.provideMerge(WorkflowEngine.layerMemory)
)
```

**Warning**: The in-memory engine does NOT provide durability guarantees. Use it only for testing.

### Custom Engine Implementation

For production, implement the `WorkflowEngine.Encoded` interface and use `WorkflowEngine.makeUnsafe`:

```ts
const engine = WorkflowEngine.makeUnsafe({
  register: (workflow, execute) => ...,
  execute: (workflow, options) => ...,
  poll: (workflow, executionId) => ...,
  interrupt: (workflow, executionId) => ...,
  resume: (workflow, executionId) => ...,
  activityExecute: (activity, attempt) => ...,
  deferredResult: (deferred) => ...,
  deferredDone: (options) => ...,
  scheduleClock: (workflow, options) => ...
})
```

The `Encoded` interface works with raw/encoded values (JSON-safe), while the `WorkflowEngine` service handles schema encoding/decoding automatically.

### Suspended Retry Schedule

When a workflow suspends (waiting for an activity or deferred), the engine retries with a default schedule of exponential backoff (200ms base, 1.5x) capped at 30s. Override per-workflow:

```ts
const MyWorkflow = Workflow.make({
  name: "MyWorkflow",
  payload: { id: Schema.String },
  idempotencyKey: (p) => p.id,
  suspendedRetrySchedule: Schedule.spaced("5 seconds")
})
```

## Complete Example: Order Processing Workflow

```ts
import { Effect, Exit, Layer, Schema, pipe } from "effect"
import { Activity, DurableClock, DurableDeferred, Workflow, WorkflowEngine } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

// --- Schemas ---

class OrderError extends Schema.TaggedClass<OrderError>()("OrderError", {
  message: Schema.String
}) {}

// --- Deferred for external payment confirmation ---

const PaymentApproval = DurableDeferred.make("payment-approval", {
  success: Schema.Struct({ transactionId: Schema.String }),
  error: OrderError
})

// --- Activities ---

const validateOrder = Activity.make({
  name: "ValidateOrder",
  success: Schema.Struct({ valid: Schema.Boolean }),
  error: OrderError,
  execute: Effect.gen(function*() {
    // validate order details
    return { valid: true }
  })
})

const reserveInventory = Activity.make({
  name: "ReserveInventory",
  success: Schema.Struct({ reservationId: Schema.String }),
  error: OrderError,
  execute: Effect.gen(function*() {
    const key = yield* Activity.idempotencyKey("reserve")
    // call inventory service with idempotency key
    return { reservationId: "res_001" }
  })
})

const shipOrder = Activity.make({
  name: "ShipOrder",
  success: Schema.Void,
  error: OrderError,
  execute: Effect.gen(function*() {
    // call shipping service
  })
})

// --- Workflow ---

const ProcessOrder = Workflow.make({
  name: "ProcessOrder",
  payload: {
    orderId: Schema.String,
    items: Schema.Array(Schema.String)
  },
  idempotencyKey: (payload) => payload.orderId,
  success: Schema.Struct({ transactionId: Schema.String }),
  error: OrderError
})

const ProcessOrderLive = ProcessOrder.toLayer((payload, executionId) =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    // Step 1: Validate
    yield* validateOrder

    // Step 2: Reserve inventory with compensation
    const reservation = yield* pipe(
      reserveInventory,
      ProcessOrder.withCompensation(({ reservationId }, _cause) =>
        Effect.log(`Cancelling reservation ${reservationId}`)
      )
    )

    // Step 3: Wait for payment (external signal)
    const payment = yield* DurableDeferred.await(PaymentApproval)

    // Step 4: Wait before shipping
    yield* DurableClock.sleep({
      name: "pre-ship-delay",
      duration: "5 minutes"
    })

    // Step 5: Ship
    yield* shipOrder

    return payment
  })
)

// --- Running ---

const MainLive = ProcessOrderLive.pipe(
  Layer.provideMerge(WorkflowEngine.layerMemory)
)

// Execute the workflow
const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const executionId = yield* ProcessOrder.execute(
    { orderId: "order_123", items: ["item_a"] },
    { discard: true }
  )

  // Later, from a webhook: complete the payment deferred
  const token = DurableDeferred.tokenFromExecutionId(PaymentApproval, {
    workflow: ProcessOrder,
    executionId
  })
  yield* DurableDeferred.succeed(PaymentApproval, {
    token,
    value: { transactionId: "tx_abc" }
  })
})
```

## Anti-Patterns

### DON'T put side effects outside activities
Non-activity code re-executes on every replay. Only put deterministic logic outside activities.

```ts
// BAD — this HTTP call runs on every replay
const result = yield* httpClient.get("/api/data")

// GOOD — wrap in an activity
const fetchData = Activity.make({
  name: "FetchData",
  success: Schema.String,
  execute: httpClient.get("/api/data")
})
const result = yield* fetchData
```

### DON'T use non-deterministic logic outside activities
Random numbers, current time, UUIDs — these all produce different values on replay.

```ts
// BAD
const id = yield* Effect.sync(() => crypto.randomUUID())

// GOOD
const generateId = Activity.make({
  name: "GenerateId",
  success: Schema.String,
  execute: Effect.sync(() => crypto.randomUUID())
})
```

### DON'T nest compensations inside activities
Compensation finalizers are only registered for top-level effects in the workflow.

## Integration with Effect Cluster

Workflows integrate with Effect Cluster for distributed execution. The Cluster module can provide a `WorkflowEngine` backed by persistent storage (e.g., a database), enabling workflows to run across multiple nodes with proper leader election and work distribution.

The `Workflow.Execution<Name>` type in the context represents the execution identity within the cluster, allowing the engine to route workflow steps to the correct node.

> **Note**: Cluster-specific `WorkflowEngine` implementations are provided by separate packages (not in the core `effect` package). The core module defines the interfaces; storage backends plug in via the `WorkflowEngine.Encoded` interface.
